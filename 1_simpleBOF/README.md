The simpleBOF scaffolded exercises.  Start with v1.  


Look at the source code v1simpleBOF.c and the solution.  See if you can figure out where the values came from.  Once you understand the basics, move on the v2, where some of the values are removed and you have to find them in the source code.  Last, you will move on to v3 and only have some commented assembly code to help you along.
